# Clean Framework

Clean Architecture components library, inspired on the guidelines created by Uncle Bob.

## Learning Resources

1. [Components Ecosystem] (/docs/components_ecosystem.md), to understand the basic usage
of each class that is part of the framework.
2. [Mockoon Installation] (/docs/mockoon.md), since the tests in the example folder require
an instance of Mockoon running.
